# WordBounding
A program to help learn about contours. The program will take a picture of page from a book and find all the words on the page. You will see all the words bounded and you can loop though all the words individually.\

I use a trackbar to loop though all the bounding boxes for the words.\
I sort the words by the order of which they should be read on the page. This can be seen in the first picture with the blue lines showing the path of reading the words.\
\
NOTE: The runtime is sort of slow mainly due to python loops being slow, so I will try to implement this same thing in C++, which I will also upload to my GitHub.
